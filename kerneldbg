Redirecting dmesg to an USB device if the Android is not showing up detailed loglevel. Can also redirect logcat to an USB. This can happen
even when SELinux is in permissive mode.IWO it cannot be completely disabled when booting with aosp image?!

init.rc file
on early-boot
#mkdir /mnt/usb
mount /dev/(usb_stick) /mnt/usb
exec /system/bin/dmesg >  /mnt/usb/dmesg.log
exec /system/bin/logcat > /mnt/usb/logcat.log
